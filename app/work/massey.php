				<h5>Challenge</h5>
				<p>In a highly competitive market, local and international universities found themselves fighting over the same students. But from a marketing point of view, it was all a sea of same-ness. Research showed that Massey had the second to lowest conversion from consideration preference across all universities. With a much smaller share of voice, Massey needed to do things differently.</p>
				<h5>Solution</h5>
				<p>The tertiary sector is rife with images of students gazing misty-eyed into the future. But the truth is that student life can be difficult and even overwhelming. We embraced the irrefutable fact that only mahi gets results. Success comes from a thousand crazy, exhausting, exhilarating moments. In a visually distinctive way, and with a whole lot of personality, we brought to life one student insight after another, showing how Massey walks beside their students to help them succeed.</p>
				<h5>Results</h5>
				<p>While the competition waved their chequebooks, we increased awareness and conversion on a small budget. Our new platform worked its socks off. Massey went from the number five spot to the most preferred University in New Zealand, in just three months. Job done.</p>
